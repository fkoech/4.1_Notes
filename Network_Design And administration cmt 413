  🔑-standards that makes network work
  🔑-How communication occur over network.
  
  
  Elements in communications
  --------------------------
  👢-message source(sender)
  👢-destination (receiver)
  👢-channel(media) - provides pathway over which the message travels.
  
  
  Protocol
  --------------
  🍧-Rules that govern communication 
 
 
 What a protocol must account
 -------------------------------------
 🍧-An identified sender and receiver
 🍧-Common language and grammer.
 🍧-Speed and timing of delivery.
 🍧-confirmation or acknowledgement requirement.
  
  
 🌿-Message encoding 🥕- first step of sending message.
                     🥕-process of converting information into another acceptable form
                      for transmission.
🌿 -Decoding - Reversed encoding in order to intercept the information.
🌿 -Encapsulation - placing one message format(letter) inside another message format envelop.
 
 
 Rules of  engagement for message timing
 ----------------------------------------
🥕 -access method
🥕 -flow control
🥕 -Response timeout
 
✔- Access method - determine when someone is able to send a message.
✔-Flow control - used to negotiate correct timing for successful correct timing for successful communication.
✔-Response Timeout - rules that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take if a responses timeout occur.


Message delivery options
----------------------
🥕-Unicast - is one -to - one delivery option
         - one/single destination for the message
🥕-Multicast - one to many delivery option.
           - a delivery of the same message to a  group of host destination simultanously.
🥕-Broadcast - one to all message delivery option.



Rules that Govern communication
-----------------------------------
✔-Protocol suite 🥕- A group of inter-related protocol necessary to perform a communication.
                 🥕- implemented by hosts and networking devices in software.

 Characteristic of a network
 --------------------------------
 -Network allows us to communicate, collaborate and interact.
 -We use it in various ways which includes:
                              web applications
                              IP telephone

                              electronic commerce
                              education
 Characteristics
 --------------------
 1.Topology - there are:
                   physical 
                   logical
             -physical topology - is the arrangement  of the cables, netwroks device and end  systems.
             -                  -describe how te network devices are actually interconnected with wires and cables.
             -Logical topology - is path over which data is transfered in a network.
                               - describe how the network devices  appear  connected to network users.
 2.Speed - speed is the measure of the data rate in  bits per second(b/s) of a  given link in a network.
          - reffers to  the network badthwidth(number of bits transmitted per second)
 3.Cost -  general expenses on purchasing of network  components, installation and maintenance.
 3.security - how protected the network is.
 3.Availability - being avaible for users when required.
 4.scalability - how easily  the network can accommodate more users and data transmission requirements.
 7.Reliability - dependability of the component that make up the network.
                 measured as a probability of failure or as the mean time between failures.
      
      
      So why routers
      ------------------
-It simplely connect one network to another.
-Without it connection between networks couldn't happen.
-Determine the best path  to the destination.
-Forward  traffic  to the next router along that path.
-route traffic between networks.
-Uses routing table to determine how to reach the destination network of a packet that arrive at its interface.
-ip packet destination might be web server or email server.
-Delivers  packets effectively.


    Is a router a computer
    -------------------------------
  -It is a special  computers.
  -It requires CPU and memory to temporarily and permanently store data to excute operating system instruction.
  -OS functions inclides:
                    initialization ,
                    routing function
                    switching function.
  -Cisco devices uses Cisco internetwork operating system(IOS) as their system software.
  -unlike other computers, it lucks:
                           video adapter
                           sound adapter
  -Routers have specialized  ports and network interfaces cards to interconnect devices to other networks.
  
  
  
  How Routers interconnect Networks
  ------------------------------------
  -A router connects multiplle networks, meaning that it has multiple interfaces that each 
   belong to a different ip network.
  -When it receives an IP packets on one interface, it detemine which interface to use to forward 
  the packet  to the destination.
  -Interface used by the router can be:
                             final destination
                             network  connected to another router.
  -Each network that a  router connects to typically requires a separate interface.
  -This interfaces are used to connect a combination of both local-area network(LANs) and 
  wide-area network(WAN)
  -LANs are commonly  ethernet networks that contains devices such as PCs, printers and servers.
  -WANS - are used  to connect  networks over a largw geographical area.
        -ie connects LANs  to internet service providers(ISP)
        
            
     You may be asking yourself how can a router chooses the best path
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   -The primary function of a router is:
             Determine the best path to send packets
             Forward packets toward the destination
   -It uses its routing table to determine the best path to use to forward a packet.
   -When it receives a packets, it examines its  destination address and uses the routing table to search 
    for the best path to that networks.
   -Routing tables also includes the interface to be used to forward packets for each known network.
   -When it matches, it encapsulates the packets into the data link frame of the outgoing or ec
    exit interface and foward it to destination.
   -A router can receive a  packet that is encapsulated in one type of data link frame, 
    and forward the packet  out of an interface that uses a different  types of data link frame.
   -Ie it can receive packet on an ethernet interface, but must forward the packet ot of an interface configured with the
    point-to-point protocal(PPP)
   -data link encapsulation depends on the type of interface on the router and the type of interface
    on the routr and type of the medium to which it connect.
   -different data links technologies that a router  can connect:
                  ethernet
                  PPP
                  frame Relay
                  DSL
                  cable.
                  wireless(802.11, bluetooth)
     -Router, receive packets, de-encapsulate, used the destination ip address  of the packet to search 
      its routing table for matching  network address. When found, encapsulate based on frame and fowrd.
     -It uses static routes and dynamic routing protocol to learn about a remove network and build their routing table.
      
     How is packet forwarding mechanism happen?
     -----------------------------------------------
     -Router support three forwarding mechanism:
                     process switching
                     Fast switching
                     cisco express forwarding
    -process switching - old packet forwarding mechanism.
                       - still in cisco routers
                       -when packet arrive on an interface,
                       -It is fowarded to the control plane 
                       -Where the CPU matches the destination address with an entry in its
                        inits routing table.
                       -Then  determine the exit interface and foward the packet.
                       -router does this for every packets and it is very slow even of of the same destination.
                       -very slow
                       -rarely implemented in modern network.
                       
      -Fast switching - common packet forwarding mechanism.
                      -uses fast switch cache to store next-hop information.
                      -When packet arrive on an interface, 
                      -Its forwarded to the control plane 
                      -where the CPU searches for a match  in the fast-switching  cache.
                      -if not there , it process-switched and forwarded to the exit interface.
                      -The flow information is also stored in the fast-switch cache.
                      -If another packet going to the same destination arrive on an interface, 
                       the next hop information in the cache is re-used without CPU intervention.
                       
       -Cisco Express forward(CEF)  -most recent and preferrd cisco ios packet-fowarding mechanism.
                                    -build a foward information base(FIB) and an adjacency table.
                                    -Table entries are not packet triggered like  fast switching
                                    -but change-triggered such as when  something changes in the network. topology.
                                    -The FBI and the adjacency table contains all the information a router would have to consider when 
                                    forwarding  a packet.
                                    -FBI contains precomputed reverse lookup.
                                    -the next hop informamtion is the for the route include:
                                          interface and layer 2 information.

What is  network system and administration?
---------------------------------------
-network system addministration is a branch of engineering that concern the operational management  of human and computer system.
 this engineering is unusual because engineering concept have specific technology solution.
-A system adminstrator work for users so that they can use a system to produce work. therefore a system adminstrator should focus 
 not on the few selfish means but all community(global).
-Once a computing device is attach in the internet, we have to consider the consequences of being directly connected to all other computing device in the world.

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Appying technology in an environment
  ---------------------------------------------
  -A key task in network system adminstration is to h/w and software configuration.
  -Both of this task(h/w, s/w configuration) are performed for users.
  -Each of this task presences its own challenges, howevery, the challanges post by this task can not be delt in issolation.
  -H/w has to conform to the constrains of the physical world.
  -h/w is subjected to power requirement, power challenges, climate and it must have conformance to the basic standards.
  -The type of h/w limite the kind of s/w that run on it.
  -S/w configuration must be carried out on the appropriate h/w.
  -Modern software in the context of global network need to interoperate and survive the possible hostilities of incompatiable and inhospitable competition.
  -In todays equipment , the major challenge is the complexity of multiple software systems, sharing a common internet space.
  -As network system adminstrators, our focus should change from the physical environment to a technological enviromement, this focus must include,
   the diversity of the constant change.
  -Part of the challenges that network adminstrator encounter is to gather for the disperate piece of the community they are serving into a harmonious whole.
  -We apply technology in a particular environment for the purpose which is intented, bearing in mind that we provide a support infrustracture.
  -The global view presented to us by information technology  means that we have to think deeply about the system that we employed.
  -The extensive filament of our internetwork system are exposed to .......both accidently and maliciously jack note.
  - N/b  ignoring such bearing will expose the organization into imaginable risk.
  -(Noovel company).

     The human Role in systems
     ----------------------------------
  -For human , the task of system administration is a very careful act,  it requires patience, understanding and experience
  -system administration work is equivalent to people working in the casualty ward in hospitals.
  -In system adminstration is further challenged that system adminstators work with limited resources,
   unfortunately, system adminstrators must manage the crisis with this limited resources.
  -Because of this challenges, we need to recognise that the answers to them are not alway written for us to copy.
  machines and computers are subject to entropy.
  -Because of this reason, we need to remain calm and attentive and learn new things everyday.
 -Computing system requires the very best of organisation skills and the most professional attitude.
  -As system adminstrators, we need to know the facts that build confidence through experience, however, we
    must also know our limitation in orders to avoid mistake that are provoked easly.
  
  
  Challenges of Network system adminstrators
  -----------------------------------------------
  -Deciding what services are needed.
  -Providing a comfortable enviroment for users.
  -Designing a network which is logical and efficient.
  -Developing ways of fixing errors and problems which occur.
  -Deploying large number of machines which can be easily upgraded later.
  -Keeping track and understanding how to use enormous amount of knowledge which increases every year.

    -testing, optimazation and documentating your networks.
    
    
    understanding the customers needs and goals
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    
    -The first step when design our network, is to understand  what the customer needs, 
     this means that we must analyse the business goals, for the current, the existing and thw new network.
     it is therefore important that we understand what will affect out network design.
    -It is almost impossible to avoid discussing the office politics in organization,
     As a network designer,be aware of office politics  but avoid getting involved as these willput your project to a risk.
    -the best you can doe is to to listen but not talk, you goal is learn about the email agenders.
    -The chaos report - it stipulate that the seventy five percent of all IT project fail.
    -In organisation there are though wars,.. and group relations that will play a great role behind your project.Notices that the project you are  undertaking is not necessary that meaning 
    they have an history that have failed before.
    -It is important  to know the people for you and who  are the people against you.
   -In some case, no matter how technically sounds your network design, the will be people will have negative reaction.
   -Be sure and find our if your project will be eliminated.
   -some network design project involve automating task that were once done by a highly failed workers, this workers will ensure that project fails.
    -As a network designer , find out whether there is an existing strategic bussiness  or IT plan.
    -It is important that your design answers the following questions:
                         -does your network design need to fix into averal architure that is bases in strategic plan.
                         -are there external regulatory or government on the planning process on the architecture.
   -Be prepared for politics that will oppose your network design and in particularly of you project has to match voice and data
   -traditionally voice and data expert have always worked independely.
   -As a network ddesigner, get to know your client business style. one aspect that you must know is tolerance and risk.

Health of the network
Safeguard  future issue(network issues)
       -scalability
       -reliability
       -standards - h/w support
                - s/w background compatibility.
-consider bandwidth and latency
-contention - 1:1 is a dedicated /broadband connection-
it has a higher throughput.
-ip address - is an address that identifies a device in a network.
-ip  address  -

  Characterizing  large internework 
-Geographical in formations
-Develop details maps to show :
-Building 
-The location of major servers, routers,  firewalls, mainframes, major network-management stations,the location and reach of virtual LANS, location of the work station.

What are the details that goes to this map
-Might depict the location of security server, 
-Dynamic service including the dynamic host configuration(DHCP), DNS
-
Characterise the 
-Tcp provide wide service to application by the udp does not
-Udp does not bother to re transmit therefore many application does not choose udp
-.udp is connection oriented.
-TCP is responsible to handle the flow control.
Upd - unreliable, connection protocol, used to for one-short, client-server-type request.
    -used in application in which prompt delivery is more important than accuracy delivery.
-modes of communication 
Half duplex - 
Full duplex - A and B sending and receiving simultaneously.
Buffering - allows devices with different speed  to communication.

Ports - msql port is 3304
Tcp header - 
Tcp communication -
