Introduction to Software project management
-----------------------------------------------
-Mr Micheal Kinyua

purpose 
---------
-Understand the efficient techniques of 

Definition of terms
--------------------
-differenciate between -data and information   - Information  is processed , organised data presented in a  given context and is useful to humans.
                                                 while  data is an individual unit that contain raw material which does not carries any specific meaning.
                       -Knowledge and intelligence - retained information while intelligence is knowledge or rather expert kno
 -process - is a kind of interelated  action or activities performed to achieve a set of product service results.
 -project -is a defined or rather plan undertaked or related activities to reach an objective that has a beginning and end 
         - a temporary endeveavior undertaken to create a unique product on services.
         
 characteristic of computer project 
 ---------------------------------------
     - plan 
     -unique
      -Non routine
    - it requires planning 
     -Predefined timeline, that is a start and end.
    
-project involves different  specialist
-project involves  several phases.


1)what is the difference between software project  and construction project/ other projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-visibility - S/w project is very hard to see the progress unlike the construction project.
-protype - 
-complexity - s/w project errors/bugs can be  solve while for construction, you demolish to solve the error.
- In Constraction site you dont need a chart to see progress, It takes shapes right infront of you, 
  while in software office it takes a little time to get used to the fact that everyone spend their day in 
  front of a screen.
  -A construction project is all about the deployment of scarce and valuable resources such are
   materials, plant and labor unlike the software developement that requires few talented people and some 
   reasonable comfortable seats.
   -Construction is a waterfall process, first you dig a hole, then you build the fundation. Each
   step is necessary to cascade down to the next step on the next project program unlike the software
    which  is largely modular, you can build the parts or features separately and glue them together.

2)Discuss 9 knowledge areas of pmiBok/pmBok
------------------------------------------------
-p - project
-m - management
-B - book
-o - of
-k - knowledge
-
-1. Project Integration management - processes and activities needed to identify, define, combine,
                                     unify and coordinate different  process and activities with project  management project group.

-2.Project scope management - It  contains milestones related to project that can help the 
                               client to know what is expected from them.
                            - it also define the following five sub-process:
                                        1.collection requirement
                                        2.Define scope
                                        3.create work breakdown structure
                                        4.verify  scope
                                        5.control scope 
3. Project Time management - 
                             It contains some sub-processes associates that makes project complete in time.
                             And they includes:
                                             Define activites
                                             sequence activities
                                             estimate the resource requiremed
                                             estimate the time required
                                             control shedule
4.Project cost management - through this one can be able to complete project in time with the exact estimate budget.
                            It consist of some sub-process that make it come to success and they include:
                             -Estimate cost
                             -Determine budget
                             -control costs
5.Project Quality Management - It align with the user requirement 
6.Project Human resource management - It the set of processes and activities involved in organizing, leading
                                      and  managing project teams.
                                     -It involve the sub-process such as:
                                            -Developing a human resource plan
                                            -Hire the project team
                                            -Develop a project team
                                            -Manage project team
7.Project communication management - poor project communication can wreck havoc on your project progress.
                                    -Should be effective and regularly to enhance collaboration and communication 
                                    among the team members.
8.Project Risk Management - It is the important factor in completin  projects successfully.
                            It plays an important role by preventing project from failure.
9.Project procurement management - it covers all aspects related to purchases and acquiring  of products and 
                                   services needed  to complete project effectively.

3)Diffenciate  between   process groups and SDLC
------------------------------------------------
-process group  are not project phases,it  focus on the project management phases while SDLC focus
 on the software engineering phasees processes, tools and techniques for building and/ implementing the
 IT solutions.

N/B Group discussion AND PRESENTATION(NEXTWEEK)
===============================================
4)with an aid/m of a diagram Discuss the  five process group and their deliverables(the reports)(five marks)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Initiating phase - triggers the planning process group.
                  
-Planning phase -  triggers the execution process group.
-Execution - is the phase where the most ofthe project work is delivered.
-Monitoring and controlling - is the only project management process group that iteract with other four.
                             It is in this phase where project team checks whether everything is 
                             going as planned
-Closing - helps to close the project after all objective are met
5)Discuss the 9 knowledge areas as defined in pmbok  by (project mgt institute/pmi)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Project integration management - includes such fundamental plans as developing a  project charter 
                                   charter that id created during the initiation phase.
                                 - Another aspect of this area is the project management plan
                                   which is developed as a project roadmap for the project to reach
                                   as successful end.
                                   
-Project scope management - This includes  plan scope management, which is part of the project management plan.
                          
-Project Time managememt - the project is divided into task, which are scheduled with start dates and deadline
                           as well as budget for  each task.
                          
-Project cost management -  this area involves the project budget, which means having good estimating tools to 
                            to make sure that the funds covers the entent of the project and are being monitored 
                            reglarly to keep stakeholders or sponsor informed.
                            
-project Quality management - 
-project human resource management - human resource management plan will identify their  roles and 
                                     roles and their   requirement  for those positions, as well as how they
                                      fit in the overall project stucture.
                                      
-projet  communication management - 
-project  risk management -  will identify how the risk wll be itemized, categories and prioritized.


-project procurement management

6)Differentciate btw s/w project  mgt and other mgt
--------------------------------------------------------
-
-
-
-
-
-
7)differenciate btw  PERT chart , GANT chart
----------------------------------------
-Gantt chart is a bar chart that lays out project tasks and timelines linearly while PERT is
 network diagram that displays all the project tasks in separate boxies and connect them with arrows
  to clearly clear show task dependencies.
-PERT  can define all task and activites required for project, the develop a realistic timeframe for project competion.
while Cantt is used to check how long each task is exprected to take , also great for visualizing
the order of specific tasks as well as the teams and individuals responsible for each task.
-
-
-
8)-Discuss  the 4 constraints of a project / sw project (time, scope, quality)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Time constraint - refers to the project's shedule for completion, including the deadline 
                  for each phase.
                  
-Scope constaint - the scope of a project defines its specific goals, deliverables, features and 
                  functions.
-Cost constraint - comprises all of the financial resources needed to complete the project on time

-
-
9)what is PMBOK
---------------
-Stands for Project managemen Body of Knowledge.
-Is is the entire collection of processes, best practices, terminologies and guideline that are accepted as standard within
 the project management industry.
10)Differenciate between mgt, project management and software project management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

summary notes
-----------------

Project life cycle management 
-----------------------------------
-Process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from inception, through  engineering design and disposal of a
 manufactured products.
- It has the following phases:
                         ideal generation
                         idea screen 
                         business analysis
                         product developement
                         Test marketing
                         commercialization
                         Evaluate and refine
 -Its main focus is:
              product features and functionalities.

Project management
------------------------
-Temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.
-Application of knowledge  skills, tools,  and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirement.



-Ability to deliver project on schedule, on budget and aligned with business goal is key to
gaining an edge in today's highly competitve globak business environment.
-IT company engage in software development can be seen  split in two parts:
              software creation
              software project management
              
project
---------
-Project is well defined task, which is a collection of several operations done in order to achieve a goal
-A  project can be characterised as:
              unique with distinct goals.
              Not a routine activity or da to day operation.
              it comes with starting and ending time
              It ends with its goal achieved.
              It requires adequate resources in terms of time, manpower finance materials.
              
              
 Software project
-----------------------
 -A complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering 
   to testing and maintanance.
 -carried out according to   the executing methodologies, in a specification       period of time to achive intendent software products.
 
 Why do we need software project management
 ---------------------------------------------
 -software products are tailor made to fit client requirement.
 -Underlying technology changes and advances so frequently and rapidly tha experience  of one product may not be  
 applied to the other one.
 -The triple constaints for software project are:
                  time
                  scope
                  cost
                  quality.
                  
software project manager
----------------------------------
-A person who undertakes the responsibility of executing the software project.
-May never directly involve in producing the end product but he controls and manages the activities inolved in production.
-closely monitors  the development  proces, prepares and executes various plans, 
                      -arranges necessary and adequate resources,
                      - maintain communication among all team members in order to address issues of cost, budget,
                       resource, time and quality and customer satisfaction.
                      -managing people
                               -Act as  project leader
                               -Liaison with stakeholders
                               -setting up reporting hierachy
                      -managing project
                                -defining and setting up project scope

                                -monitoring  progress and performance
                                -Risk analysis every phase
                                -Take necessary steps to avoid or come out of propblems
                                -act as project spokesperson.


software management activities
---------------------------------
-It contains planning of project, deciding scope of software product, estimate the cost of various terms.
 shedule of tasks and  event and resource management.
- project management activities.
               project planning
               scope management
               project estimation

-Project planning 
-----------------------
-Performed  before the productions of software actually starts.
-Rather is it a set of multiple processes, which facilitaes software production.
-May include:
             Scope management - includes all the activites , process need to be done in order to make a
                                a deliverable software product.
                                -It is essential because it  boundaries of the project by clearly defining 
                                 what would be done in the project and  what would not be done.
                                -In it  the phase you:
                                               define the scope
                                               decide i

   Meaning and definition of project management
   --------------------------------------------------
-Project management - discipline of planning, organising  and managing resource
                        to bring about the successful completion of specific project goals and objectoves
                        
-The primary  challenge of project management - achieving all of the project goals and objectives
                                              while honoring project constraints
-Typical contrains are - scope
                         time
                         budget
-project - set of activities that use resources(money, people, materials, energey, space
           communications, motivation) to achieve the project goals  and objectives
-Project management definition by project management institutes -the application of knowledge, skills
 , tools and techniques to project activities in order to meet or exceed stakeholders needs and expectations.
 project management definition by project body  of knowledge - application of knowldge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to archieve project requirement.
-project management is accomplished through,  the application and integration of the
 the project management processes .
 -project management process of initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling and closing.
 -Project management is a  carefully planned and organized effort to accomplish a specific one-time effort.
 -Project management includes: 
                            developing a project plan that includes  defining project goals,
                            specifying how the goals will be accomplished, 
                            and what resource are needed and related budget and time for completion.
                            Also implementing the project plan, along with careful control to ensure that
                            project is being managed acccording to the plan.
                            
                            Functions of project management
                            ------------------------------------
-setting realistic exepectations
-fostering agreement among all parties
-delivering the prodduct.
-The three above lead to project management function since they are challenging and require a wide array of techniques.
1. project definition - lay out the foundation for a project.
                      - involves two activities:
                          a)project manager must determine the purpose, goals and constraints of the projects.
                          b)the manager must establish basic project management controls.
2. project planning - puts together the details of how to meet the project's goals, given the constrains.
3. project conrols - includes all activities that  keeps  the project moving towards the goals:
                            progress measurement
                            communications
                            corrective actions
 -Functions are sequential - project must begin with definition, the proceed to plannning  and finally to control.
 
 
 
 
       importance of project management
       ------------------------------------
-It is rapidly becoming a standard way of doing business.
-A typical firm's effort is being devoted to projects.
-The future promises an increase in the importance and the role of project in contributing to the 
strategic direction of organizations.
1. compression of product life cycle - most significant driving forces behind the demand for project management.
                                     - time to market for new project with short life cycle has become incresingly important.
2.Global competition - Today's open market demands not only cheaper products and service but also better products and services.
3.Knowledge explosion - the growth in new knowlwdge has incresed the complexity of project because project encompass the latest advances.
4.corporate downsizing - downsizing and sticking to core  competencies have become necessary for survivals for many firms
                       - change is a constant, project management is replacing middle management as a way of ensuring that thingd get done.
5.Increased customer focus - increased competition has a premium on customer satisfactions.
                           - customers no longer simply  settle for generic product and service.
                           -They want customized products and services that cater to their specific needs
  
           

6.Rapid development of third world and closed economies -  many firms  are using project management
 techniques to establish distribution channel and foreign bass operations.


Poject management process
--------------------------------
-Split into five groups:
       1.initiation process
       2.Planning process
       3.implementation process
       4.controlling process
       5. closing the process
-all the processes are interrelated as the output of one process becomes the input for other.
-Centrol process groups(Planning, implementation and control), all   the links are looped.
-Planning process provides a documented project plan to the implementation process
 which in turns provides documented update to the planning processes as the project progress.
1. initial prcoess - process of formally identifying the presence of a new project or passing of the ongoing  project to the next phase.
-entails determination  of the main objective and forming a clear understanding about 
the necessity and suitability of the project.
a-Identification and initial analysis of the business needs
b-Determining of the main objectives
c-resource analysis(people, equipment, financial )
d-composition of the project charter.
2.planning process - include two kinds: 
                   -core process - processes that are interdependent and must be  performed in sequence in
                                  almost all the projects.
                   -facilitating process - performed  as and when they are required in the project planning phase.
 -entails determination of an optimal scheme/algorithms for project execution
e- needs analysis
f- description of the project
g - composition of project plan
h - planning and performing necessary pr- activities

3. implementation process - involves core process and facilitating processing.



Core proecss
------------------
-The process of implementing the project plan.
-A major portion of the project budget is spent on this process.
-This process requires the project manager, the top management and the project team to support one 
another and co-ordinate their activities.


Facilitating process
------------------------------
-scope verification - process of getting the project scope formally approved by the
                      stakeholders of the project.
                     - Ensures the satifactory accomplishment of all the project deliverables.
                     
-Quality assurance - Process of evaluating the total perfomance of the project regularly, in
                    order to ensure that the project confirms  to the quality standards.

-Team development - process of making the required information  available to project stakeholders.
-Information distribution - making the required  information available to project stakeholders
-solicitation - gathering information in the form of bids, quotations and proposals from qualifies vendors to satisfy the project needs
-Vendor sections - accepting bids, quotations or proposals and evaluating vendors.
-Contract administrations - ensuring that the vendor delivers materials as per the requirement of the contract.
i - starting the execution
j - Day- to -day management
k -  change management and reporting

project management tools
------------------------------
1-Program evaluation and review techniques(PERT) - model for  project management design
 analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project.
 -primarly simplify the planning  and scheduling of large and complex project.
 -Able to incorpoate uncertainty by possible to shedule a project while not knowing precisely the detailed and duration of all
 the activities.
 -more of event- oriented technique rather than start completion-oriented 
 -used in more R&D type project where time rather than cost, is the major factor.
 -Intended for very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine projects.
 
2-critial path method( CPM ) - applied where the activity times are more or less certain.
